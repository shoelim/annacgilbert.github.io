# Miscellaneous Notes

#### This repository contains some notes (in the form of technical reports) on various topics of ```probability theory and its applications``` that I write up whenever I encounter interesting topics and ideas in my research. Some of these notes are introductory in nature, while others may contain novel results. In the latter case, they are either too incomplete or unpolished (work in progress/postponed work due to time constraint) for submission to a first-rate journal (at least for now). However, I am happy to share them with interested reader (please read them at your own risk!) and hence the creation of this repository. Any comments and suggestions on these notes are welcome.
