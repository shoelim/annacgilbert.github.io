excerpt: "Outside of Academia"

Outside of academia, I invest my time in various activities and adventures. Here are some of them: <br>


### Technology 
I am particularly interested in the future of internet: [Web 3.0](https://www.web3.university/) and the related applications. The key feature of Web 3.0 is that data will be interconnected in a decentralized manner, in contrast to the current generation of the internet (Web 2.0) where data is mostly stored in a centralized way. I am constantly learning and exploring the building blocks of Web 3.0: blockchain, cryptocurrency, and AI. I am also interested in [autonomous EVs](https://www.tesla.com/AI), decentralized finance, NFTs, DAOs, sustainable technologies, technology investing, and more.


### Biohacking 
I am constantly adding little hacks into my daily life to help maintain and improve my health and fitness (both physical and [metabolic](https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-metabolic-fitness)). Bringing down my [biological age](https://lifespanbook.com/) would be a bonus. I have been doing intermittent fasting and following a mostly low carb, Mediterranean-style diet. Other hacks that I have been using include: having a [micronutrient smoothie](https://fastlifehacks.com/dr-rhonda-patrick-diet-and-exercise/#Micronutrient_Rich_Smoothies), having a [natto](https://www.nyrture.com/why-natto) dish with high quality olive oil, exercising, doing sauna and cold showers, [meditating](https://www.headspace.com/meditation), sleeping >8 hours, among others.


### Traveling 
I enjoy traveling to different countries and collecting the unique experience each country offers. I have been to more than 15 countries in 4 different continents so far. I have also enjoyed hiking and other outdoor activities whilst visiting these countries. 

Finally, I enjoy reading and talking to people about mathematics, physics, ML, the topics mentioned above, and life in general.
