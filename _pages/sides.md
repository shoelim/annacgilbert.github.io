Outside of academia, I invest my time in various projects and adventures.

Consulting
======
I offer expert consulting service to help you understand and solve AI and machine learning problems using principled, scientific approaches. If you are curious about how AI and machine learning can help your organization, or need help with a project in any phase, I am passionate to help you with your needs. Please contact me (via email) for more information on this.


Technology 
======

I am particularly interested in [Web 3.0](https://www.web3.university/). The key feature of Web 3.0 is that data will be interconnected in a decentralized manner, in contrast to the current generation of the internet (Web 2.0) where data is mostly stored in a centralized way. I am constantly learning and exploring the building blocks of Web 3.0: blockchain, cryptocurrency, and AI. I am also interested in autonomous electric vehicles, decentralized finance, NFTs, sustainable technologies, and technology investing.


Biohacking 
======

I am constantly adding small hacks into my daily life to help maintain and improve my health and fitness (both physical and [metabolic](https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-metabolic-fitness)). I have been doing intermittent fasting and following a mostly low carb, Mediterranean diet. Other daily hacks that I have been using include: having a [micronutrient smoothie](https://fastlifehacks.com/dr-rhonda-patrick-diet-and-exercise/#Micronutrient_Rich_Smoothies), having a [natto](https://www.nyrture.com/why-natto) dish with high quality olive oil, exercising, [meditation](https://www.headspace.com/meditation), sleeping >8 hours, among others.


Traveling 
======

I enjoy traveling to different countries and collecting the unique experience each country offers. I have been to more than 12 countries in 4 different continents so far. I have also enjoyed hiking and other outdoor activities whilst visiting these countries.
