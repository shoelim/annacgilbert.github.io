- I am an applied mathematician working in <font color="blue">machine learning</font>. Prior to this, I worked in [<font color="blue">mathematical physics</font>](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mathematical+physics) and, broadly speaking, <font color="blue">probability theory and its applications</font>. <br> 
- I am currently an Assistant Professor and a WINQ Fellow at <a href="https://www.nordita.org/">Nordita</a>, hosted jointly by <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> and <a href="https://www.su.se/">Stockholm University</a>. <br> 
- I completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics at the <a href="http://math.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona</a> in May 2018, under supervision of <a href="http://math.arizona.edu/~wehr/">Jan Wehr</a>. Prior to that, I studied mathematics and physics at the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. <br>  

We are organizing a biweekly e-seminar to discuss the state-of-the-art of scientific machine learning this year. Sign up [here](https://scientific-ml.org/) to stay updated! <br>  


*I am looking for highly motivated students (bachelor/master) and postdocs to join the group.
