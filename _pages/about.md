- I am an applied mathematician working in  [<font color="blue">mathematical data science</font>](https://www.onr.navy.mil/en/Science-Technology/Departments/Code-31/All-Programs/311-Mathematics-Computers-Research/mathematical-data-science) (machine learning) and [<font color="blue">mathematical physics</font>](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mathematical+physics) (statistical mechanics), and, broadly speaking, <font color="blue">probability theory and its applications</font>. <br> 
- I am currently a Nordita fellow at <a href="https://www.nordita.org/">Nordita</a>, hosted jointly by <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> and <a href="https://www.su.se/">Stockholm University</a>. <br> 
- I completed my PhD in applied mathematics at the <a href="http://math.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona</a> in May 2018, under supervision of <a href="http://math.arizona.edu/~wehr/">Jan Wehr</a>.   <br> 
- Prior to that, I studied mathematics and physics at the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. <br>
