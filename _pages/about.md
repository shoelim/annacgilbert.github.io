- I am an applied mathematician working in  <font color="blue"><b>mathematical data science</b></font> (machine learning) and <font color="blue"><b>mathematical physics</b></font> (statistical mechanics), and, broadly speaking, <font color="blue"><b>probability theory and its applications</b></font>. <br> 
- I am currently a Nordita fellow at <a href="https://www.nordita.org/">Nordita</a>, hosted jointly by <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> and <a href="https://www.su.se/">Stockholm University</a>. <br> 
- I completed my PhD in applied mathematics at the <a href="http://math.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona</a> in May 2018, under supervision of <a href="http://math.arizona.edu/~wehr/">Jan Wehr</a>.   <br> 
- Prior to that, I studied mathematics and physics at the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. <br>

<i>I am currently on the academic job market.</i>
