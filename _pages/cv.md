Biography
=====
I am an applied mathematician working in  <font color="blue"><b>mathematical data science</b></font> (machine learning) and <font color="blue"><b>mathematical physics</b></font> (statistical mechanics) and, broadly speaking, <font color="blue"><b>probability theory and its applications</b></font>. <br> 
I am currently a Nordita fellow at <a href="https://www.nordita.org/">Nordita</a>, hosted jointly by <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> and <a href="https://www.su.se/">Stockholm University</a>. <br>
I completed my PhD in applied mathematics at the <a href="http://math.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona</a> in May 2018, under supervision of <a href="http://math.arizona.edu/~wehr/">Jan Wehr</a>.   <br>
Prior to that, I studied mathematics and physics at the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. <br>
<i>I am currently on the academic job market</i>. <br>

My research interests are in probabilistic and dynamical aspects of machine learning and statistical mechanics, as well as the related interactions and applications in science and engineering. In particular, I apply and develop ideas and tools from several areas of probability theory, stochastic analysis, statistical learning, statistical mechanics and dynamical systems to address problems concerning <b>open dynamical systems</b></font> arising in statistical mechanics and machine learning. Open systems are, in a broad sense, components of a larger closed system that interact with other components of the larger system. These systems abound in applications and are typically random/stochastic, nonlinear, high-dimensional and have non-trivial dynamics. The overarching theme of my research revolves around using mathematics to understand <i>learning of dynamical representations</i> and <i>physics of dynamical systems</i>.
