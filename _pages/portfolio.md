My primary research interests are in <font color="blue">probabilistic machine learning</font>, particularly learning with <font><i>modern</i></font> neural networks, as well as the related interactions and applications in science and engineering. <br>

On a high level, my current research is inspired and driven by the following fundamental question: 

<font><i>Given a data model, a learning model and a learning algorithm, can we build a *rigorous* yet *practical* framework to explore and exploit the "behavior" of the learning model on test data, in various regimes and for various settings? </i></font><br>

Some central themes related to the above question that I am investigating:<br>
- Randomness in/of/for robust and reliable machine learning (the "setting")
- Implicit regularization in machine learning (the "regime")
- Machine learning through the lens of dynamical systems and statistical mechanics (the "framework")
<br>
<br>

In particular, I apply and develop ideas and tools from several areas of probability theory, stochastic analysis, statistical learning, statistical mechanics and dynamical systems to address problems concerning <font color="blue">open dynamical systems</font> arising in statistical mechanics and machine learning. <br>

Open systems are, in a broad sense, components of a larger closed system that interact with other components of the larger system. These systems abound in applications and are typically random/stochastic, nonlinear, high-dimensional and have non-trivial dynamics. Studying physical and artificial systems rigorously within an appropriate open systems framework allows us to gain valuable insights into these systems. The overarching theme of my current research revolves around using probabilistic and statistical approaches to understand <font color="blue"><i>learning of dynamical representations</i></font> and <font color="blue"><i>physics of dynamical systems</i></font>.  <br>
