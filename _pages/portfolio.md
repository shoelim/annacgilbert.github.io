My research interests are in probabilistic and dynamical aspects of machine learning and statistical mechanics, as well as the related interactions and applications in science and engineering. 

Current research projects:<br>
- Asymptotic and nonasymptotic behavior of modern neural networks 
- Implicit regularization of modern neural networks
- Principled dynamical systems approaches to designing and understanding learning models
<br>
