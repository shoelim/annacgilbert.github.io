My research interests are in probabilistic and dynamical aspects of machine learning and statistical mechanics, as well as the related interactions and applications in science and engineering. In particular, I apply and develop ideas and tools from several areas of probability theory, stochastic analysis, statistical learning, statistical mechanics and dynamical systems to address problems concerning <font color="blue">open dynamical systems</font> arising in statistical mechanics and machine learning. <br>

Open systems are, in a broad sense, components of a larger closed system that interact with other components of the larger system. These systems abound in applications and are typically random/stochastic, nonlinear, high-dimensional and have non-trivial dynamics. Studying physical and artificial systems rigorously within an appropriate open systems framework allows us to gain valuable insights into these systems. The overarching theme of my current research revolves around using mathematics and interdisciplinary approaches to understand <font color="blue"><i>learning of dynamical representations</i></font> and <font color="blue"><i>physics of dynamical systems</i></font>.  <br>

Current research projects:<br>
- Asymptotic and nonasymptotic behavior of noisy neural networks 
- Implicit regularization of noisy neural networks
- Principled dynamical systems approaches to designing neural networks
