Generalized Langevin systems are a class of non-Markovian open dynamical systems with memory in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. We focus on stochastic homogenization and model reduction for dynamics and functionals of multiscale generalized Langevin systems, and their applications to the study of effective dynamics and thermodynamics of physical diffusive systems. <i>Check out the relevant research outputs [<b>here</b>](https://shoelim.github.io/publications/).</i>
