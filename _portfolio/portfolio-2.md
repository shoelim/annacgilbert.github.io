Many models of noisy systems are too complex to be solved analytically, or even numerically if a large range of time scales is involved. For a wide class of high-dimensional dynamical systems it may be possible to derive lower-dimensional reduced models. The reduced models are often simpler to solve analytically and faster to integrate numerically, while still retaining the essential features of the full system. When time scale separations exist one can apply multiscale methods such as averaging and homogenization to study model reduction. 

We focus on stochastic homogenization for dynamics and functionals of multiscale generalized Langevin systems, an important class of non-Markovian open dynamical systems with memory in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. We apply our method to study effective dynamics and thermodynamics of physical diffusive systems. <i>Check out the relevant research outputs [<font color = "blue">here</font>](https://shoelim.github.io/publications/).</i>
