Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of powerful open system models in machine learning that have also enjoyed synergies with disciplines such as neuroscience, signal processing, optimization, control theory and network science. The explosion of real-time data (physical or not) and the promising potential of using complex dynamical systems (physical or not) to learn the data are opening up a wide range of foundational and practical problems. We are working on various mathematical and application aspects of RNNs and related models in deep learning. <i>Check out the relevant research outputs [<font color = "blue">here</font>](https://shoelim.github.io/publications/).</i>
