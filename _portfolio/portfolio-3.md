title: "(3) Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of open dynamical systems"
collection: portfolio
---
Nonequilibrium dynamics, classical or quantum, are far more common in nature than equilibrium ones. Therefore, understanding nonequilibrium behavior is a fundamental task in statistical mechanics and could even inspire developments in other fields such as machine learning and neuroscience. However, it is more challenging than understanding equilibrium ones, and often requires new mathematical techniques and physical insights.

In collaboration with theoretical physicists, we have worked on various nonequilibrium aspects of open classical and quantum systems: noise-induced critical transitions, stochastic thermodynamics, quantum Brownian motion (using theory of open quantum systems and quantum stochastic calculus). <i>Check out the relevant research outputs [<font color = "blue">here</font>](https://shoelim.github.io/publications/).</i>
