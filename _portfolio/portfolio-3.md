title: "(3) Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of open dynamical systems"
collection: portfolio
---
Nonequilibrium dynamics are far more common in nature than equilibrium ones. In collaboration with theoretical physicists, we have worked on various nonequilibrium aspects of open classical and quantum systems: noise-induced critical transitions, stochastic thermodynamics, quantum Brownian motion. <i>Check out the relevant research outputs [<font color = "blue">here</font>](https://shoelim.github.io/publications/).</i>
