title: "(3) Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of open dynamical systems"
collection: portfolio
---
Nonequilibrium dynamics are far more common in nature than equilibrium ones. Therefore, understanding nonequilibrium behavior is a fundamental task in theoretical physics. However, it is more challenging than understanding equilibrium ones and often requires new insights and techniques.

In collaboration with theoretical physicists, we have worked on various nonequilibrium aspects of open classical and quantum systems: noise-induced critical transitions, stochastic thermodynamics, quantum Brownian motion (using theory of open quantum systems and quantum stochastic calculus). <i>Check out the relevant research outputs [<font color = "blue">here</font>](https://shoelim.github.io/publications/).</i>
