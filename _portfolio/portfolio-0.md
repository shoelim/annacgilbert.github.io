My research interests are in probabilistic and dynamical aspects of machine learning and statistical mechanics, as well as the related interactions and applications in science and engineering. In particular, I apply and develop ideas and tools from several areas of probability theory, stochastic analysis, statistical learning, statistical mechanics and dynamical systems to address problems concerning <font color="blue">open dynamical systems</font> arising in statistical mechanics and machine learning. Open systems are, in a broad sense, components of a larger closed system that interact with other components of the larger system. These systems abound in applications and are typically random/stochastic, nonlinear, high-dimensional and have non-trivial dynamics. The overarching theme of my research revolves around using mathematics and interdisciplinary approaches to understand <i>learning of dynamical representations</i> and <i>physics of dynamical systems</i>.
